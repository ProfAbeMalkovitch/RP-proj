🧩 Overview

Traditional digital learning platforms often deliver generic, non-adaptive content and lack meaningful engagement features.
This project introduces an AI-assisted, teacher-supervised e-learning ecosystem that delivers personalized micro-learning experiences with curriculum alignment, adaptive pathways, and real-time motivational analytics.

The system integrates four interconnected components:

Education Content Extraction & Structuring Engine (ECESE)

Intelligent Learning Pathway Generator (ILPG)

Micro-Learning via Daily Challenges

Progress Monitoring & Streak Analytics System (PMSAS)

🧠 1. Education Content Extraction & Structuring Engine (ECESE)

Developer: B. Iroshan

Purpose

Automatically extract, parse, and structure educational content (from PDFs, textbooks, and teacher guides) aligned with national curricula.

Features

Curriculum-guided taxonomy and ontology mapping

NLP-based parsing of text, tables, and diagrams

Teacher dashboard for content validation

Integration-ready structured data for other system modules

Technologies

NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers

Parsing Tools: Apache PDFBox, PyPDF2

Backend: Spring Boot / Node.js

Frontend: React.js / React Native

Database & Storage: MongoDB / Firebase / AWS S3

Evaluation

≥90% curriculum adherence (validated by teachers)

Dataset: Grade 10–11 and undergraduate educational material
