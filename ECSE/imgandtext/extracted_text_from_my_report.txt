E-learning platform - Personalized Micro-Learning with Adaptive Content Structuring and 
Progress Analytics 
TIM - Technology Integration and Management 
Information Technology (IT) 
Despite the increasing availability of digital educational resources, current e-learning platforms often fail 
to provide structured, personalized, and engaging learning experiences that align with formal curriculum. 
Students particularly in school and undergraduate levels struggle to remain consistently engaged and 
often lack tailored support to address individual learning gaps. 
Our proposed solution is a Learning Platform app that’s designed for two key actors: Teachers and 
students. the app empowers Grade 10–11 students and undergraduates by offering personalized daily 
lessons, adaptive quizzes, and gamified progress tracking(quizzes leaderboards) and these help teachers 
keep track of student performance as well. The platform uses uploaded content (e.g., textbooks, teacher 
guides) to generate daily learning tasks and interactive challenges inspired by micro-learning principles. 
Ai models can be used for this task too one core issue is that most AI models, while powerful, lack the 
ability to stay within the educational scope of a teacher’s intent, often overwhelming students with 
irrelevant information. To address this, our Education Content Extraction and Structuring Engine uses 
teacher guides to filter and deliver only the most relevant content automating a traditionally manual and 
inconsistent process [A. Mostrady, E. Sanchez-Lopez, and A. F. Gonzalez-Sanchez, "Microlearning and its 
Effectiveness in Modern Education: A Mini Review," Acta Pedagogia Asiana, vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 33–42, 2025]. 
We also implement an Intelligent Learning Pathway Generator that uses performance data to adapt the 
student’s journey through the curriculum. This builds upon proven frameworks in adaptive learning that 
emphasize personalization as a key to improved retention and outcomes [A. Donevska-Todorova, K. 
Dziergwa, and K. Simbeck, "Individualizing Learning Pathways with Adaptive Learning Strategies: Design, 
Implementation and Scale," Proc. Int. Conf. Educ. Technol. Res., pp. 576–583, 2025.]. 
To promote consistency, our Progress Monitoring and Streak Analytics System is inspired by consumer 
apps like Snapchat, where streaks are proven to foster daily user engagement. This not only keeps 
students involved but also gives teachers a real-time view of student participation and progress through 
leaderboard metrics [Snapchat, 2024]. 
Finally, our Micro-Learning via Daily Challenges integrates short, focused quizzes and lessons. Research 
supports that microlearning enhances attention and retention in secondary education, especially when 
paired with gamified experiences [M. A. M. Attia, M. A. A. Ahmed, and L. A. A. Abdalsmd, "Integration of 
Adaptive Microlearning in Secondary Education," Int. J. Innov. Sci. Res. Technol., vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 751–
755, Jan. 2025].

The proposed solution is a smart learning platform designed to deliver personalized and 
curriculum-aligned learning experiences for Grade 10–11 students and undergraduates. The 
system allows students to upload educational content such as textbooks, lecture slides, and 
teacher’s guides. Using these inputs, the platform intelligently extracts and structures relevant 
lessons, ensuring that the material delivered stays within the scope outlined by subject experts. 
Central to the solution is an AI-powered Education Content Structuring Engine that reads 
teacher guides and reorganizes uploaded by the student into content into short, focused 
lessons, the teacher oversees if the content is relevant and is in scope. A Intelligent Learning 
Pathway Generator analyzes student performance data to build adaptive learning routes that 
evolve based on quiz results, skipped topics, and repeated mistakes. 
The platform incorporates gamification through streaks, badges, and leaderboards, managed 
by a Progress Monitoring and Streak Analytics System, which not only motivates students 
through habit-forming features but also provides teachers with engagement insights. 
To encourage consistency, the system delivers daily micro-challenges in the form of brief 
quizzes and tasks, similar to Duolingo’s model. These tasks are guided by structured content 
and teacher-approved logic, maintaining educational credibility. The result is a personalized, 
interactive, and adaptive learning journey designed to improve engagement, retention, and 
academic outcomes.

7. Brief description of specialized domain expertise, knowledge, and data requirements 
(300 words max) 
 
 
 
This project falls under the Technology Integration and Management (TIM) research cluster, 
requiring specialized knowledge in educational technology, requirement engineering, user 
engagement strategies, and human-computer interaction (HCI). The proposed learning platform 
integrates multiple components content structuring, adaptive learning pathways, progress 
tracking, and gamified micro-learning all of which combines computing, teaching strategies, and 
behavioral insights. 
To develop the Education Content Extraction and Structuring Engine, foundational knowledge 
in natural language processing (NLP) and curriculum design is necessary. The ECESE engine must 
understand how to interpret teacher’s guides and textbooks, extract learning objectives, and 
map them to structured learning content all while maintaining curriculum scope and relevance. 
The Intelligent Learning Pathway Generator requires an understanding of adaptive learning 
systems, learner profiling, and personalized recommendation logic. Familiarity with data-driven 
learning platforms and pathway generation techniques (e.g., decision trees, rule-based engines) 
is essential. 
Building the Progress Monitoring and Streak Analytics System involves working with 
engagement analytics, motivation theory, and streak-based behavioral tracking. Expertise in 
usability analytics and social gamification will support the design of features like leaderboards, 
streak indicators, and actionable insights for teachers.  
To implement Micro-Learning via Daily Challenges, the team must be able to design concise, 
educationally effective lessons and assessments requiring a grasp of instructional design, HCI 
principles, and gamification frameworks. 
Data Requirements include: 
 
Publicly available textbooks, teacher guides, and past exam papers (Grade 10–11 and 
undergraduate level). 
 
User interaction data such as quiz performance, task completion rates, and streak logs 
(collected via trials or simulations). 
 
Teacher or domain expert feedback to validate content alignment and adaptive 
recommendations.
