🔍 Completed Work

Conducted an in-depth literature review using sources from Google Scholar and Education Sciences (2023) on adaptive learning using AI.

Analyzed multiple AI/ML approaches used in adaptive learning systems:

Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) – for tracking learners’ mastery levels in real-time.

Decision Tree (C4.5) – for categorizing learners based on quiz results and recommending appropriate content.

Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) – for continuously improving path generation through feedback loops.

Evaluated algorithm strengths, scalability, and interpretability for e-learning contexts.

⚙️ Ongoing Work

Comparing algorithm performance and suitability for quiz-based learning adaptation.

Designing a hybrid adaptive model combining Decision Tree (for initial path classification) and BKT (for continuous knowledge tracking).

Preparing the conceptual architecture for integrating these algorithms into the system backend (Spring Boot / Node.js).

🎯 Next Steps

Finalize the primary algorithm to implement in the adaptive engine.

Create flow diagrams and pseudo-code for the algorithm’s data flow and decision process.

Begin prototype development for backend integration with quiz analytics data.
